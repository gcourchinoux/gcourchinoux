# about this github account 


Hi, my name is Gaspard COURCHINOUX and i'm a low level developer. 

I have write a instruction set architecture : is the Gaspard architecture. 

On this github account, you will find the implementation of this architecture to GNU toolchain. 



# gcc 
the base of the port is gnu gcc 10. 

the Gaspard backend is generating correct code. Need to write test. The port of the linux kernel will be a massive usefull test ! 


# binutils 

Need to write the support of jump and branch (b. and jmp , jsr). 

need to write into libopcodes and gas. 

# linux kernel

I have not started yet, I have started to read the documentation.
